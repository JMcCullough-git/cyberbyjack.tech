# Writing cheatsheet

How I write, format and publish posts for The Cyber Seal Report. Everything here works in Obsidian and on the site.

## Publishing workflow

1. **Start the article.** I press `Ctrl + N` for a blank note, then click the **<%** Templater icon in the left ribbon → **New article** → type the title. Templater moves the note to `content/posts/<title>/index.md` and fills in the properties.
   - Command palette alternative: `Ctrl + P` → "Templater: Create new note from template" → **New article**.
   - The **<%** icon needs an open note. With nothing open, Templater shows "No active editor".
2. **Fill in the properties** at the top: `dek` and `tags` (see Article properties below).
3. **Write the body** under the properties.
4. **Drag in images.** Obsidian saves them in the article's folder.
5. **Set the cover.** I rename the lead image to `cover` (right-click → Rename), or type its file name in the `cover` property.
6. **Publish.** I untick `draft`, then run **Git: Commit-and-sync** (Obsidian Git icon in the left ribbon, or `Ctrl + P` → "Git: Commit-and-sync"). The post goes live in about a minute.

**Fixing a published post:** I edit the note and run Commit-and-sync again.

## Article properties

| Property | What it does |
|---|---|
| `title` | The headline. Any punctuation works: `?`, `!`, `&`, `:`, quotes. The web address drops it: "Is Your Router Lying?" lives at `/posts/is-your-router-lying/`. |
| `dek` | One-sentence hook under the title and on cards. Plain text only, no formatting. |
| `tags` | The first tag is the red category pill. |
| `cover` | File name of the lead image (or I just name the image `cover`). |
| `coverAlt` | Short description of the cover image for screen readers. |
| `draft` | Ticked keeps the post off the site. I untick it to publish. |
| `featured` ☑ | Pins the post as the big lead story on the home page, however old. If several are ticked, the newest ticked one wins. |
| `hideFromHome` ☑ | Keeps the post off the home page. It still appears under Articles, tags, Archive and RSS. |

**Home page:** it shows two stories, the lead (big card) and one beside it. Without `featured`, the newest post leads. Everything else lives on the Articles page.

**Older posts without the checkboxes:** I add them in Properties (**+ Add property** → `featured`, type Checkbox) or type `featured: true`.

### Tags

Obsidian tags can't contain spaces, so I use hyphens: `threat-research` shows as **Threat Research**.

Tags in use: `investigations`, `threat-research`, `vulnerabilities`, `tooling`, `data-breaches`, `phishing-scams`, `social-engineering`, `privacy`, `OSINT`, `malware`.

## Text formatting

| I type | It shows | Obsidian shortcut |
|---|---|---|
| `**bold**` | **bold** | `Ctrl + B` |
| `*italic*` | *italic* | `Ctrl + I` |
| `<u>underline</u>` | <u>underline</u> | none |
| `==highlight==` | ==highlight== (soft red on the site) | none |
| `~~strikethrough~~` | ~~strikethrough~~ | none |
| `` `code` `` | `code` | none |
| `<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>` | <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> key caps | none |
| `H<sub>2</sub>O`, `x<sup>2</sup>` | H<sub>2</sub>O, x<sup>2</sup> | none |

- Formats combine: `**<u>bold and underlined</u>**`.
- Formatting works in the body, tables and story blocks, not in `title` or `dek`.
- I skip font colors and background colors. They clash with the design and may not show on the site.

## Story blocks

```markdown
> [!quote]
> The pull quote: big text with the red bar.

> [!note]
> Grey box for context, method, or caveats.

> [!disclosure]
> Red box for who was notified and when.

> [!note] Custom label
> Any title after the type replaces the label.
```

## Tables

```markdown
| Indicator | Type | First seen | Status |
|---|---|:---:|---:|
| `185.220.101.44` | C2 server IP | Aug 14 | **Active** |
```

- **Insert:** right-click in the note → **Insert → Table**, or type it. Obsidian's table editor adds rows and columns.
- **Alignment:** colons in the second line set it. `:---` left (default), `:---:` center, `---:` right.
- **Inside cells:** bold, highlight, `code` and links all work.
- **Wide tables** (hashes, file paths) scroll sideways on their own instead of stretching the page. I put hashes, IPs and domains in `code` so they never break mid-value.

## Code blocks

````markdown
```bash {title="check_build.sh"}
grep -r "password" /etc
```
````

The title shows in the dark bar above the code, next to a Copy button. Without `{…}`, the bar shows just the language.

## Images in articles

```markdown
![Caption shown under the image as "Fig. 1"](screenshot.png)
```

- An image on its own line becomes a numbered evidence figure, but only if it has a caption.
- File names with spaces (like Obsidian's `Pasted image …png`) are fine.
- The site publishes resized copies with **GPS and camera metadata stripped**. The original files never go online.

## Images for emails and other uses

For images outside an article, like a logo for a Kit email: anything in the `static` folder goes live at the same path, so `static/images/my-file.png` becomes `https://cybersealreport.com/images/my-file.png`.

**The easy way (Windows File Explorer + Obsidian Git):**

1. In File Explorer, I open my vault folder and go to `static\images`.
2. I copy my image into it.
3. In Obsidian, I run **Git: Commit-and-sync**. It picks up every change in the vault, not just notes.
4. About a minute later, it's live at `https://cybersealreport.com/images/<file-name>`.

**Without my PC:** on GitHub, I open the repo → `static/images` → **Add file → Upload files**, and commit to `main`.

Rules for these files:

- **File names:** lowercase with hyphens and no spaces (`seal-banner-2026.png`). The file name becomes the web address.
- **Photos:** these files go online exactly as they are, so I strip location data first. Right-click the file → Properties → Details → **Remove Properties and Personal Information**. Graphics I made myself are fine.
- **Replacing an image:** saving over an existing name updates it everywhere, including emails already sent. I use a new name when old emails should keep the old image.

## Notes to myself

```markdown
<!-- Notes like this never appear on the site or in the RSS feed. -->
